The model is most sensitive to the likelihood of preventing future diabetes in patients identified with GDM using postdelivery counseling and intervention.", "answer": "yes"}
{"pmid": "20602101", "question": "Is hypoalbuminemia an independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer?", "long_answer": "Low albumin concentrations are associated with poorer survival in patients with gastric cancer. However, the strength of this relation with survival is dependent on the presence of a systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by an elevated CRP level. Therefore, it appears that the relation between hypoalbuminemia and poor survival is secondary to that of the systemic inflammatory response.", "answer": "no"}
{"pmid": "12145243", "question": "Are lower fasting plasma glucose levels at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes associated with improved outcomes?", "long_answer": "People presenting with type 2 diabetes with lower initial glycemia who may be earlier in the course of their disease had fewer adverse clinical outcomes despite similar glycemic progression. Since most such people are asymptomatic at diagnosis, active case detection programs would be required to identify them.", "answer": "yes"}
{"pmid": "20736672", "question": "Does perspective-taking increase patient satisfaction in medical encounters?", "long_answer": "Perspective-taking increased patient satisfaction in all three studies, across medical schools, clinical disciplines, and racially diverse students and SPs. Perspective-taking as a means for improving patient satisfaction deserves further exploration in clinical training and practice.", "answer": "maybe"}
{"pmid": "9363244", "question": "Does occupational nuclear power plant radiation affect conception and pregnancy?", "long_answer": "The data suggest that occupational exposure due to ionizing radiation should be investigated as a possible cause for involuntary temporary sterility and as a risk factor for early pregnancy disorders.", "answer": "yes"}

{"pmid": "28196511", "question": "Antiretroviral therapy related adverse effects: Can sub-Saharan Africa cope with the new \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization?", "long_answer": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "answer": "no"}
{"pmid": "23761381", "question": "Is calibration the cause of variation in liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry testosterone measurement?", "long_answer": "The variation in results obtained could not be attributed to variations in calibrators. The differences in methodologies between laboratories must be the reason for this variation.", "answer": "no"}
