This directory contains six Jupyter notebooks that implement core components of the voice-based multimodal signal pipeline for Parkinson’s disease research. The included modules cover:

- **Speech-to-text transcription and spectrogram processing**
- **HuBERT acoustic feature extraction**
- **BERT text embedding generation**
- **CLIP-based spectrogram feature extraction**
- **Cross-attention fusion of multimodal features**
- **LLM fine-tuning for multimodal PD classification**

These notebooks have been developed as part of the ongoing collaboration with mAGI to advance multimodal approaches for Parkinson’s disease detection.
