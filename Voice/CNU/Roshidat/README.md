This directory contains six Jupyter notebooks that implement core components of the voice-based multimodal signal pipeline for Parkinson’s disease research. The included modules cover:
Speech-to-text transcription and spectrogram processing
HuBERT feature extraction
BERT text embeddings
CLIP-based spectrogram feature extraction
Cross-attention fusion
LLM fine-tuning for multimodal PD classification
These notebooks have been developed as part of the ongoing collaboration with mAGI to advance multimodal approaches for Parkinson’s disease detection.
